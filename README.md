# Oxus Flashcards

https://oxus.netlify.com

Electronic flashcards. Solo project. 

Started the project with zero React skills.

2 months of intense training and study:
- learned enough to build a larger app with database, users, authentication and functional UI.

LESSONS:
- UI design, consistent styling, takes about 10 000 years. USE A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT, e.g. material-ui/spectrum etc.
- learn before doing. IT'S FASTER. nothing takes longer than getting stuck every few steps and trying to re-invent the wheel on a small code block.
- do, before learning for too long. IT'S CRITICAL TO LEARN ONLY THE FEW THINGS I NEED + the environment.
- these are two opposites that need to come together:
a) learn before doing, ALWAYS,
b) code it soon enough, ALWAYS.

Why? Why learn before doing? Why code it soon enough?
- if you don't overlearn and learn just enough context/syntax to not get stuck, 
- and then you code just what you need, after you've learned it...
- that takes SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TIME - WITH THE SAME INPUT UNKNOWNS / COMPLICATIONS TO PLOW THROUGH

LESSONS SUMMARY:
If you have a given input piles of unknown stuff - learn before doing/code soon enough is like f(x) => y, where you get more y out of *same* x of unknown stuff to code.
That's my current hypothesis, anyway.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
From ~ 0 React skills to building a larger React app with database/authentication, custom hooks, and more.
Huge challenge.
2 months of intense training, study and hardcore yet meditative learning and coding sessions.
Biggest time-sinks: CSS and not using something like material-ui. By far. Refactors. Coding before learning.
Learned: React hooks, custom hooks, React context, firebase, integrating React with REST API endpoints.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

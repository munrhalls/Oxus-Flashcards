# Oxus Flashcards

Electronic flashcards. Solo project. 

Started the project with zero React skills.

2 months of intense training and study:
- learned enough to build a larger app with database, users, authentication and functional UI.

LESSONS:
UI
- styling UI takes a lot of time, especially in terms of RWD and consistency
- UI in this app is PRETTY POOR, actually - too much going on
- in general, UI needs to just do its job...little is better than too much
- occasional slight effect here and there for the feel of it, that's alright

Sense before code. 
- Everything needs to be solved conceptually, it has to make sense on paper, first.
- I learned that already in my first job but...
- This app taught me a lot of painful lessons that doing a lot of skipping on these paper-solutions, isn't a good idea. 
- It doesn't save time, it quickly comes back to waste a ton more time than it'd take to solve it on paper first.
- every paper-solution takes time but it saves the need for 10-50 required code-solutions later on




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
